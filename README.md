# End_to_End_Finance_ChatBot

End_to_End_Financial_Fraud_Anomaly_Detection: Developed and deployed a robust financial fraud anomaly detection solution leveraging the XGBoost algorithm with 86% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score. Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), executed data preprocessing and feature engineering incorporating the SMOTE Technique to address class imbalance. Developed and trained Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, and experiment tracking using MLflow. Implemented Data Version Control (DVC) for data management and established a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with Jenkins, containerizing applications with Docker for deployment on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
