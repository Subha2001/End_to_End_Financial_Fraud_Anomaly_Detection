# A few notes on this Dockerfile:
# Base Image: We are using a lightweight Python image (python:3.9-slim).
# Working Directory: The /app directory in the container will hold your application files.
# Dependency Installation: We copy requirements.txt first, to leverage Dockerâ€™s build cache, and then install the Python packages.
# Port Exposure: Streamlit by default runs on port 8501. We expose that port.
# CMD: The command starts the Streamlit app. Here, we rely on the environment variables we set for port and address, but you can also pass them as arguments if needed.
